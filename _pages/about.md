I'm an undergraduate student in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in computer science and technology ([Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm), [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp)).

I'm still exploring my interest in research, including Computer Vision and AI for Science. During the exploration, my contribution is acknowledged in [Modeling Protein Structure Using Geometric Vector Field Networks](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.07.539736v1).
