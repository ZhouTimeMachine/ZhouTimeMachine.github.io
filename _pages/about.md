I'm a first year PhD student in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in computer science and technology, advised by Prof. [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/).

I'm still exploring my interest in research, including *generative modeling* (now familiar with *diffusion models*), *computer vision* and *AI for science*. If any collision of ideas is expected, please email me at <a href="mailto:zhoujianjun@zju.edu.cn">zhoujianjun@zju.edu.cn<a/>.

When I have any publication, my photo will be updated. ðŸ˜„
