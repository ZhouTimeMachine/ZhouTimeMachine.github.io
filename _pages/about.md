I'm a first year PhD student in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in computer science and technology, advised by Prof. [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/), Prof. [Tong He](https://tonghe90.github.io/) and Prof. [Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/).

I'm still exploring my interest in research, including *generative modeling*, *world model* and *3d vision*. If any collision of ideas is expected, please email me at [zhoujianjun@zju.edu.cn](mailto:zhoujianjun@zju.edu.cn).

To recover 4D world, up to now we still need a few good snapshots of it; however, I have taken no good snapshot of myself yet, so this dog may serve as a better placeholder than my real photo?ðŸ˜„
